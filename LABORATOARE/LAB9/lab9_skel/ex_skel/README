Tester for Calculatorul Didactic

Setup:
-modify the path in line 5, "call C:\Xilinx\14.6\ISE_DS\settings32.bat", from start_test.bat to correspond with your Xilinx installation (use "settings64.bat" if you are running the 64bit version); if you followed the Xilinx install tutorial, the default path should work.
-you can change the parameters at the start of the "tester" module in "tester/tester.v" to see more/less debug output.

Running:
-copy your Verilog implementation
-run (double-click) start_test.bat; execution log will be in "results.log"
-you can enable the simulator GUI by appending "gui" to line 8 in start_test.bat
-you can run selected tests by removing unwanted ones from "tests" folder
