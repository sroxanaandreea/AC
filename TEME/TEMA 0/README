Tester for Homework 0: Learning vmchecker

Setup:
-modify the path in the "call C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\settings32.bat" line in start_test.bat to correspond with your Xilinx installation (use "settings64.bat" if you are running the 64bit version); if you followed the Xilinx install tutorial, the default path should work.
-you can change the 3 parameters at the start of the "tester" module in "tester/tester.v" to see more/less debug output.

Running:
-copy your Verilog files in the root of the folder
-run (double-click) start_test.bat
